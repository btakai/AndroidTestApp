	This is the first app tutorial from the android developer website.
	I am mainly using it to experiment with features that I may or may
	not want inside of any future apps that I create.
	
	ToDo:		Set up onclicks for the buttons in the login activity

	July 7, 2013:	Added a login activity
			Modified the manifest so that the login activity is
				viewed when the app is launched	

	July 6, 2013:	Created a template for testing Parse User Login

	Second Test:	July 1, 2013
			Worked on retrieving Parse objects with queries
			Experimented with different types of getX commands 
				for basic query

	First Test:	databasing and working with Parse
			"parse.com"
